# App Store – React Practice Project

This is a **basic React practice project** built to understand component-based UI, state management, props, and responsive design.  
It simulates a simple **App Store** interface where users can browse apps by category and search for specific apps dynamically.

## About

This is a beginner-friendly React project developed as part of my frontend learning practice.
It helped me strengthen my understanding of core React concepts and clean UI structuring.

## Project Overview 

The App Store project allows users to:
- View apps organized into categories such as **Social**, **Games**, **News**, and **Food**.
- Switch between categories using **tab buttons**.
- Search for apps instantly using the **search bar**.
- View all matching apps displayed neatly in a responsive grid layout.

This project is part of my learning journey in mastering **React fundamentals** like props, state, conditional rendering, event handling, and CSS media queries for responsiveness.


## Tech Stack

- **React.js** – For building the UI components  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For logic and interactivity  
- **CSS Flexbox & Media Queries** – For responsive layout  
- **Create React App** – For bootstrapping the project


## How to Run Locally

To run the project on your local system:

git clone <your-repo-link>  

cd appstore    # Navigate into the project folder

npm install    # Install dependencies

npm start    # Start the development server


## Learning Goals

Through this project, I practiced:

- Building UI using **React functional components**
- Using React hooks (`useState`) for state management
- Passing data through props
- Handling user interactions like search and tab clicks
- Applying conditional rendering
- Designing a responsive layout using CSS
